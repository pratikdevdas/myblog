Long story short. I am a developer loves to code, read, edit videos, create graphic designs. To another domain I like football, movies and traveling. And at times, I try reflecting upon the mysteries of universe and improving my grammar.

#### Despite having multiple blogs over the internet, I needed another. Why?

To simply answer, I want to record everything I learn every day. So I have a doc to put my eyes upon when I feel like. Well, my father used to tell me to write everything I read in a summary. Unfortunately I was never able to ðŸ¥². But yeah I can amaze him by typing.

 _I hope you find something worth  learning that changes your life._ ðŸ˜›
